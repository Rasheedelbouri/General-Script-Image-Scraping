# arabicLanguageImageWork

This is a code to automatically scrape images from the bing search engine. 

Parameters are to be changed in the main_scrape.py file.

Parameters are the word to be searched (put in the list as a string) and the number of images you want it to return.

Due to Arabic language not being compatible with writing in terminal, I'm afraid you'll have to alter the parameter in the script itself.

You will not necessarily get the number of images that you specify. This is due to there being quite a few inconsistencies in the html of images included in the bing search.

Fastest performance is to run the main_scrape.py from terminal.
